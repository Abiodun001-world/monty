# Monty Project

The Monty project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on building a simple interpreter for Monty Bytecode files. The project aims to deepen your understanding of programming concepts, data structures, and file handling in C programming language.

## About the Monty Project

The Monty project is designed to provide hands-on experience in implementing an interpreter for Monty Bytecode files. Monty is a programming language that uses a stack-based data structure and operates on a stack of values. The project challenges you to build a program that can read and interpret Monty Bytecode files, executing the operations defined in those files.

This project requires a strong understanding of data structures, file handling, and the C programming language. It also allows you to develop skills in parsing, tokenization, and implementing stack-based operations.

## Project Features

The Monty project includes the following features:

- **Monty Bytecode Interpreter**: Implement a program that can read and interpret Monty Bytecode files.
- **Stack Operations**: Support various stack operations such as push, pop, swap, add, subtract, multiply, divide, and more.
- **File Handling**: Read and process Monty Bytecode files, executing the operations defined in the file.
- **Error Handling**: Handle errors and display appropriate error messages for invalid operations or incorrect file formatting.

These features challenge you to implement a robust interpreter that can correctly parse Monty Bytecode files and execute the specified operations.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Monty project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and open it in your preferred integrated development environment (IDE).
3. Review the provided source code files, which include the implementation of the Monty interpreter.
4. Familiarize yourself with the syntax and structure of Monty Bytecode files.
5. Compile the source code to generate an executable file.
6. Use the executable file to interpret Monty Bytecode files by providing the file as a command-line argument.

Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your machine to compile the Monty source code.

## Usage

To use the Monty interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Compile the source code by running the following command:

   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty
   ```

2. Execute the Monty interpreter with a Monty Bytecode file by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ./monty path/to/monty_bytecode_file
   ```

3. Observe the output and verify that the operations defined in the Monty Bytecode file are executed correctly.

Feel free to explore the source code files, modify and enhance the project as you gain a deeper understanding of the Monty interpreter and the Monty Bytecode language.
